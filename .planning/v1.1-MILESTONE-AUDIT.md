### Unsatisfied (6) — All Phase 11

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | Reason |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| TRANS-01 | Landing page in Bulgarian | 11 | Phase not started |
| TRANS-04 | Bulgarian-market form options | 11 | Phase not started |

### Deferred (1)

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | Reason |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| SUBN-06 | Pricing/payment adapts to sub-niche | 8 | Deferred to v1.x per research recommendation |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**All 18 connections verified by integration checker.** Key wiring:

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| Phase 6 i18n | Phase 7 translations | `useTranslation()` + JSON namespaces | WIRED |
| Phase 6 value/label | Phase 8 sub-niche options | `toOptions()` in Steps 2, 3, 7 | WIRED |
| Phase 8 SubNiche types | Phase 9 scoring weights | `getWeightsForSubNiche()` import | WIRED |
| Phase 8 state.subNiche | Phase 10 submitAudit | `formState.subNiche` in insert | WIRED |
| Phase 6 useLang() | Phase 10 submitAudit | `lang` parameter from `useLang()` | WIRED |
| Phase 10 DB columns | Phase 10 send-notification | Webhook payload auto-includes columns | WIRED |

**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0 (1 by-design deferral: SubNicheSelector i18n labels → Phase 11)
**Broken flows:** 0

## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: English Audit Submission
Landing → Niche select → Sub-niche select → Steps 1-8 → Generate (scores weighted by sub-niche, language + sub-niche persisted to DB, AI prompt personalized) → Report

**Status: COMPLETE**

### Flow 2: Admin Notification
Audit submitted → report_status = 'completed' → DB webhook → send-notification reads language/sub-niche → email displays both fields with language-aware report URL

**Status: COMPLETE**

## Tech Debt Summary

| Phase | Items | Severity |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 6 | 4 human verification items | Low (observational) |
| 7 | 3 human verification items + 2 hardcoded strings (unreachable) | Low |
| 8 | Missing SUMMARY.md files; SubNicheSelector English-only labels | Low |
| 10 | 3 human verification items; dead code path in generate-report | Low |

**Total: 13 items across 4 phases** — all low severity, no blockers
