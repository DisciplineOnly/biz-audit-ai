<objective>
Extract all hardcoded field labels, placeholders, hints, and section headers from Step 1-4 components into the steps.json namespace. Option labels (the toOptions arrays) stay as-is because their values are scoring keys.

Purpose: Steps 1-4 contain the densest concentration of niche-conditional text. Extracting them completes half of the form step translation.
Output: Steps 1-4 fully using t() calls for all labels/hints/placeholders. steps.json populated with step1-step4 content.

Key design decisions:
- Fields that differ by niche use `hs`/`re` sub-keys (e.g., `step3.fields.responseSpeed.hs.label`)
- Fields that are the same for both niches use flat keys (e.g., `step3.fields.leadSources.label`)
- Option arrays (`toOptions(...)`) are NOT extracted — they remain in the component files because their string values are scoring keys. Their labels will be translated in Phase 11 when Bulgarian content is added.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `public/locales/en/steps.json` is valid JSON
- All step1-step4 field labels, placeholders, and hints are present
- Niche-conditional fields have both `hs` and `re` sub-keys
  </verify>
  <done>steps.json populated with all Step 1-4 field labels, placeholders, hints, and section headers. Niche-conditional text uses hs/re sub-keys.</done>

For each step component file:

1. Add import: `import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';`

2. Inside the component, add: `const { t } = useTranslation('steps');`

3. Replace all hardcoded strings with t() calls matching the keys defined in Task 1.

**Step1BusinessInfo.tsx:**
- StepHeader: `title={t('step1.title')}` `subtitle={t('step1.subtitle')}`
- FormField labels: `label={t('step1.fields.businessName.label')}`, etc.
- Placeholders: `placeholder={t('step1.fields.businessName.placeholder')}`, etc.
- Section header: `isHS ? t('step1.hs.sectionHeader') : t('step1.re.sectionHeader')`
- HS field labels: `t('step1.hs.industry.label')`, `t('step1.hs.employeeCount.label')`, etc.
- RE field labels: `t('step1.re.role.label')`, `t('step1.re.teamSize.label')`, etc.
- Hints: `t('step1.hs.serviceArea.hint')`

**Step2Technology.tsx:**
- StepHeader: `title={t('step2.title')}` `subtitle={t('step2.subtitle')}`
- CRM label: `isHS ? t('step2.fields.primaryCRM.hs.label') : t('step2.fields.primaryCRM.re.label')`
- CRM placeholder: `placeholder={t('step2.fields.primaryCRM.placeholder')}`
- Satisfaction label: `isHS ? t('step2.fields.crmSatisfaction.hs.label') : t('step2.fields.crmSatisfaction.re.label')`
- Satisfaction hint: `t('step2.fields.crmSatisfaction.hint')`
- Tools label: `t('step2.fields.toolsUsed.label')`
- Tools hint: `t('step2.fields.toolsUsed.hint')`
- Tech frustrations: label, hint, placeholder from `step2.fields.techFrustrations.*`

**Step3LeadFunnel.tsx:**
- StepHeader: `title={t('step3.title')}` `subtitle={t('step3.subtitle')}`
- Each field label: look up from `step3.fields.*`, using `.hs.label` / `.re.label` for niche-conditional ones
- For niche-conditional labels, pattern: `isHS ? t('step3.fields.responseSpeed.hs.label') : t('step3.fields.responseSpeed.re.label')`
- For shared labels: `t('step3.fields.leadSources.label')`

**Step4Scheduling.tsx:**
- StepHeader is niche-conditional:
  - HS: `title={t('step4.hs.title')}` `subtitle={t('step4.hs.subtitle')}`
  - RE: `title={t('step4.re.title')}` `subtitle={t('step4.re.subtitle')}`
- HS field labels: `t('step4.hs.fields.schedulingMethod.label')`, etc.
- RE field labels: `t('step4.re.fields.followUpPlan.label')`, etc.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT change the `toOptions()` arrays or their string values. These are scoring keys and must remain as-is. Only the `label` prop (field label), `hint` prop, `placeholder` prop, and `StepHeader` title/subtitle should be translated.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors
- `npm run dev` — navigate Steps 1-4:
  - All field labels render correctly for both HS and RE
  - All placeholders show correct text
  - All hints display
  - StepHeader shows correct title/subtitle
  - No hardcoded English strings remain in these files (except option arrays passed to toOptions, which are intentionally untranslated)
- Form functionality unchanged: values save correctly, validation works
  </verify>
  <done>Steps 1-4 fully converted to t() calls for all field labels, placeholders, hints, and section headers. Option arrays remain as-is for scoring compatibility. The form renders identically to pre-Phase-7.</done>

1. `npm run build` completes without errors
2. `npm run test` passes
3. Navigate through Steps 1-4 in both HS and RE modes — all labels, placeholders, hints render correctly
4. Form state saves correctly to localStorage
5. No hardcoded English field labels remain in Step1-Step4 components
6. steps.json contains complete step1-step4 section
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Steps 1-4 use t() for ALL field labels, placeholders, hints, and section headers
- steps.json contains all step1-step4 field strings with proper niche-conditional structure
- Option arrays (toOptions) remain unchanged — scoring is unaffected
- Build passes with zero errors
- Steps 1-4 render identically to pre-Phase-7
</success_criteria>
