<objective>
Extract all hardcoded field labels, hints, and the Step 8 completion banner from Steps 5-8 into the steps.json namespace. This plan parallels 07-03 (can run in the same wave) and completes the form step extraction.

Purpose: After this plan, all 8 step components use t() for user-visible text (except option arrays which are scoring keys).
Output: Steps 5-8 fully using t() calls. steps.json complete with all 8 steps.

Important: Step 5 and 6 have fully niche-separated field structures (HS and RE have completely different fields), so the entire fields block is inside `hs`/`re`. Step 7 shares a KPI field but has niche-specific others. Step 8 shares the biggest challenge field but has niche-specific others.

For each step component:

1. Add import: `import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';`
2. Inside the component: `const { t } = useTranslation('steps');`
3. Replace all hardcoded strings with t() calls.

**Step5Communication.tsx:**
- StepHeader: `title={isHS ? t('step5.hs.title') : t('step5.re.title')}` `subtitle={isHS ? t('step5.hs.subtitle') : t('step5.re.subtitle')}`
- HS fields: `label={t('step5.hs.fields.appointmentReminders.label')}`, etc.
- RE fields: `label={t('step5.re.fields.agentClientComms.label')}`, etc.

**Step6FollowUp.tsx:**
- StepHeader: `title={isHS ? t('step6.hs.title') : t('step6.re.title')}` `subtitle={isHS ? t('step6.hs.subtitle') : t('step6.re.subtitle')}`
- HS fields: `label={t('step6.hs.fields.postJobFollowUp.label')}`, etc.
- RE fields: `label={t('step6.re.fields.postCloseFollowUp.label')}`, etc.

**Step7Operations.tsx:**
- StepHeader: `title={t('step7.title')}` `subtitle={t('step7.subtitle')}`
- HS fields: `label={t('step7.hs.fields.performanceMeasurement.label')}`, etc.
- RE fields: `label={t('step7.re.fields.agentPerformanceMeasurement.label')}`, etc.
- Shared KPI field: `label={t('step7.fields.kpisTracked.label')}` `hint={t('step7.fields.kpisTracked.hint')}`

**Step8Financial.tsx:**
- StepHeader: `title={t('step8.title')}` `subtitle={t('step8.subtitle')}`
- HS fields: `label={t('step8.hs.fields.estimateProcess.label')}`, etc.
- RE fields: `label={t('step8.re.fields.expenseTracking.label')}`, etc.
- Shared biggest challenge: `label={t('step8.fields.biggestChallenge.label')}` `hint={t('step8.fields.biggestChallenge.hint')}` `placeholder={t('step8.fields.biggestChallenge.placeholder')}`
- Completion banner: `t('step8.completionBanner.title')` and `t('step8.completionBanner.description')`

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT change the `toOptions()` arrays. These are scoring keys.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors
- `npm run dev` — navigate Steps 5-8 in both HS and RE modes:
  - All field labels render correctly
  - Step 8 completion banner shows correct text
  - No hardcoded English strings remain (except toOptions arrays)
- Form functionality unchanged
  </verify>
  <done>Steps 5-8 fully converted to t() calls. All 8 step components now use i18n for labels, hints, placeholders, and section headers. The form renders identically to pre-Phase-7.</done>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` completes without errors
2. `npm run test` passes
3. Navigate all 8 steps in both HS and RE modes — all text renders correctly
4. Step 8 completion banner appears with correct messaging
5. steps.json is valid and contains complete step1-step8 content
6. No hardcoded English field labels remain in any Step component
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Steps 5-8 use t() for ALL field labels, hints, placeholders, and the Step 8 banner
- steps.json is complete with all 8 steps
- Option arrays unchanged — scoring unaffected
- Build passes with zero errors
- All 8 steps render identically to pre-Phase-7
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-english-translation-pass/07-04-SUMMARY.md`
